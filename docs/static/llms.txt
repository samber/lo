# Lo - A Go library for functional programming

Lo is a comprehensive, production-ready Lodash-style Go library built on Go 1.18+ generics that provides hundreds of utility functions for working with slices, maps, strings, channels, functions, and more. It aims to make Go code more expressive, readable, and productive by offering a rich collection of functional programming helpers inspired by libraries like Lodash in JavaScript.

## Origins and Purpose

Born from the need to fill gaps in Go's standard library after the introduction of generics in Go 1.18, Lo addresses common pain points that Go developers face daily. While Go's standard library gained some generic helpers in `slices` and `maps` packages, Lo goes far beyond with 300+ carefully crafted utilities that make functional programming patterns natural and idiomatic in Go.

The library emerged from real-world production needs and has been battle-tested in numerous high-traffic applications, microservices, and enterprise systems. It's not just a collection of utility functions, but a thoughtful toolkit that enables developers to write more declarative, maintainable, and bug-free code.

## Key Features

- **Generic-based**: Fully leverages Go 1.18+ generics for compile-time type safety
- **Zero dependencies**: No external dependencies outside the Go standard library
- **Comprehensive**: 300+ helpers covering slices, maps, strings, channels, functions, and more
- **Functional programming**: Brings functional programming paradigms to Go naturally
- **Production-ready**: Battle-tested in high-traffic applications worldwide
- **Well-tested**: 95%+ test coverage with comprehensive examples
- **SemVer compliant**: Follows strict semantic versioning (v1.x.x stable)
- **Performance-focused**: Minimal runtime overhead with optimized implementations
- **Memory efficient**: Many helpers avoid allocations and use zero-copy patterns
- **Composable**: Designed to work together in method chains and complex pipelines

## Sub-packages

The main package is complemented by several specialized sub-packages:

- **lo**: Core package with 300+ helpers for everyday operations
- **lo/parallel**: Parallel processing helpers for concurrent operations
- **lo/mutable**: In-place mutation helpers for memory-efficient operations
- **lo/it**: Iterator helpers for lazy evaluation and streaming

## Design Philosophy

Lo is built on a foundation of pragmatic engineering principles that balance power, safety, and performance:

1. **Type Safety First**: All helpers leverage Go's generics for compile-time type checking, eliminating runtime type assertions and reducing bugs
2. **Go Idiomatic**: While inspired by functional programming, helpers feel natural in Go code and follow established conventions
3. **Performance Conscious**: Every helper is benchmarked and optimized for minimal overhead, with many using zero-copy patterns
4. **Explicit Clarity**: Helper names clearly communicate their purpose and behavior
5. **Composable by Design**: Functions work together seamlessly, enabling elegant data transformation pipelines
6. **Memory Efficient**: Careful attention to allocation patterns, with many helpers avoiding unnecessary heap allocations
7. **Error Handling Respect**: Helpers don't hide errors; they integrate naturally with Go's error handling patterns
8. **Practical Over Pure**: Prioritizes solving real-world problems over theoretical purity

## Usage Examples

### Basic Collection Operations

```go
import "github.com/samber/lo"

// Remove duplicates from a slice
names := lo.Uniq([]string{"Samuel", "John", "Samuel"})
// []string{"Samuel", "John"}

// Filter and transform in one operation
numbers := lo.FilterMap([]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(item int, index int) (string, bool) {
    if item%2 == 0 {
        return fmt.Sprintf("even-%d", item), true
    }
    return "", false
})
// []string{"even-2", "even-4"}
```

### Advanced Data Processing

```go
// Complex data transformation pipeline
users := []User{{ID: 1, Name: "Alice", Active: true}, {ID: 2, Name: "Bob", Active: false}}

// Group active users by name length, then extract IDs
activeUserIDs := lo.Pipe(
    users,
    lo.Filter(func(u User) bool { return u.Active }),
    lo.GroupBy(func(u User) int { return len(u.Name) }),
    lo.MapValues(func(users []User) []int {
        return lo.Map(users, func(u User) int { return u.ID })
    }),
)
// map[int][]int{5: []int{1}}

// Safe nested data access
config := map[string]any{
    "database": map[string]any{
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 5432,
    },
}

host := lo.ValueOr(lo.CoalesceMap(
    lo.MapValues(config, func(v any) map[string]any {
        if m, ok := v.(map[string]any); ok {
            return m
        }
        return nil
    }),
), "localhost")
```

### Concurrency and Async Operations

```go
// Parallel processing of large datasets
results := lop.Map(items, func(item Item) Result {
    return processItem(item) // Executed in parallel
})

// Debounce API calls to avoid rate limiting
debouncedSearch := lo.NewDebounce(300*time.Millisecond, func() {
    results := searchAPI(query)
    updateUI(results)
})

// Safe error handling with fallbacks
result, ok := lo.TryOr(func() (int, error) {
    return dangerousOperation()
}, 0)
```

### Functional Control Flow

```go
// Elegant conditional logic
message := lo.If(user != nil, "Welcome back!").
    ElseIfF(isGuest, func() string { return "Welcome guest!" }).
    Else("Please login")

// Retry logic with exponential backoff
result, err := lo.AttemptWithDelay(3, time.Second, func(i int, d time.Duration) error {
    return callExternalAPI(context.Background())
})

// Transaction management
tx := lo.NewTransaction[Order]()
defer tx.Rollback()

order, err := tx.Run(func() (Order, error) {
    inventory := checkInventory(items)
    if !inventory.Available {
        return Order{}, errors.New("insufficient inventory")
    }
    return createOrder(user, items)
})
```

## Performance Considerations

Lo is engineered for performance-critical applications with several optimization strategies:

### Memory Efficiency
- **Zero-copy patterns**: Many helpers avoid unnecessary allocations by working with existing data
- **Slice reuse**: Mutable variants (`lo/mutable`) enable in-place operations for memory-constrained environments
- **Lazy evaluation**: Iterator patterns in `lo/iter` support streaming of large datasets
- **Pre-allocation**: Collection sizes are pre-calculated when possible to minimize reallocations

### Performance Characteristics
- **Compile-time optimization**: Generic types enable compile-time specialization and optimization
- **Minimal overhead**: Most helpers add zero or single-digit nanosecond overhead
- **Cache-friendly**: Linear memory access patterns for better CPU cache utilization
- **Branch prediction**: Hot paths are optimized for common case execution

### Benchmarks and Optimization
Every helper includes comprehensive benchmarks covering:
- Different input sizes (small, medium, large)
- Various data types (int, string, structs)
- Comparison with standard library alternatives
- Memory allocation tracking

```go
// Example benchmark results for lo.Uniq vs manual implementation
BenchmarkLoUniq-8          1000000    1200 ns/op    800 B/op   4 allocs/op
BenchmarkManualUniq-8       5000000     240 ns/op     0 B/op   0 allocs/op  (when in-place)
```

### Production Optimization Tips
1. **Use `lo/it`** for large datasets when memory is a concern
2. **Leverage `lo/parallel`** for CPU-bound operations on large collections
3. **Choose appropriate helpers** - some have specialized variants for specific use cases
4. **Profile your code** - use Go's built-in profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
5. **Consider streaming** - use iterators for very large datasets that don't fit in memory
